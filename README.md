I have created a spring boot application for storing employee details
These are function that can be performed with this application: - 
	Post Employee,
	Get All Employees,
	Get a particular employee by ID,
	Get a particular employee by name,
	delete a particular employee by id,
	update details of an employee,
	soft delete a particular employee,
  Added validations also
	
I have used intellij idea to write codes.
